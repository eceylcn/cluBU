2021 Spring - A website work that I took on most of the development part with my team for CET102 course at Boğaziçi University. All HTML &amp; CSS files except calendar.html are developed by me, Ece Yalçın.

1. At home page, sliding explanatory buttons added. By clicking them, you can see, with smooth transition behavior, what the website is about.

2. A simple reviews page added. It informs other users about website as well as it includes advices about school clubs. 
Another function is that users (including visitors) can leave their opinions & comments.

3. An arrow which takes us top of the page added for usability purposes.

4. Navigation bar includes mainly 3 properties: main page, sign up page, sign in page.

5. At registration page, sign up form added. It gives 2 choice to user: cluBBer or not. After you signed up, a different interface welcomes you.

6. If you are cluBBer , which means if you are the leader of a club, it allows you manage your club details such as events and club members after you signed up. 
This function shows up as “ Kulübüm & Etkinlikler

7. However, if you are not a cluBBer , you can still see "Kulübüm & Etkinlikler". But this time, it allows user to see their clubs they’ve enrolled and their activies such as posts they shared.
In this prototype, I could make only the user’s side. We can see a little feed here about the clubs’ activities which the user has enrolled as a member.

8. Clubs can create application forms for their events and enable them for their members.

9. A payment system added for clubs’ entry fees. Normally, members pay the entry fee face to face as they stood in front of clubs’ stands with a huge crowd; but in this system, we made this case easier.
They pay to club directly from here with an online payment system. Fees are 20₺ per year for BOUN clubs and 20₺ per semester for non BOUN clubs.

10. The only function we’ve used from the outside is this “calendar & events” widget. 
Here user can see available events of many clubs around Istanbul in chronological order. They can see date & place information about events and send invitations via email or copying the link.
